Code for the paper: Active $k$-Labelsets Ensemble for Multi-label Classification

## Introduction

Random $k$-labelsets ensemble (RA$k$EL) is a multi-label learning (MLL) strategy that integrates a number of single-label learning models. Each single-label model is constructed by label powerset (LP) technique based on a randomly generated size-$k$ label subset. RA$k$EL can improve the generalization capability and reduce the complexity of the original LP method, but the quality of the randomly generated label subsets could be low. On one hand, the transformed classes may be hard to separate in feature space, causing negative effects on the performance; on the other hand, the classes might be highly imbalanced, causing difficulties in using existing single-label algorithms. To deal with these problems, this paper proposes an active $k$-labelsets ensemble (AC$k$EL) paradigm. Borrowing the idea of active learning, a label selection criterion is proposed to evaluate the separability and balance level of the classes transformed from a label subset. Then, by randomly selecting the first label or label subset, the remaining ones are iteratively chosen based on the proposed criterion. AC$k$EL can be realized in both disjoint and overlapping modes, which adopt a pool-based framework and a stream-based framework, respectively. Experimental comparisons demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods.
